This is the course project of 02456 Deep learning 2020 at Technical University of Denmark.

The main purpose of the project is applying UNet based deep convolutional neural network to predict the traffic map in the immediate future.

The original data was obtained from the challenge. [Traffic4cast 2020] (https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/). It needs to be mentioned that the course project is not carried out exactly by the requirement of the challenge.

It was contributed by Zhijie, Federico and Chao.
