This is the course project of 02456 Deep learning 2020 at Technical University of Denmark.

The main purpose of the project is applying UNet based deep convolutional neural network to predict the traffic map in the immediate future.

The original data was obtained from the challenge. [Traffic4cast 2020](https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/). It needs to be mentioned that the course project is not carried out exactly as the requirement of the challenge.

The repository contains the following files.

 * U-net-dec2nd-1.ipynb : The main notebook, which includes the main result of the course project.
 * data_utils.py: Code for data preprocessing.
 * visualization.py: Code for visualization of the result.
 

It was contributed by Federico, Chao and Zhijie.
